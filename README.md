# DE10-Lite VHDL Labs

## Lab Overview
This repository contains VHDL labs completed for a **Digital Principles** course on the DE10-Lite FPGA board. The labs cover a variety of fundamental digital design concepts. The software used in this course was **Quartus Prime Lite Edition**, where all the code was written and compiled in. 

Each lab folder contains VHDL files for each completed lab. I've also included a pdf of the DE10-Lite pin configuration in the folder **de10_lite_pins**.


## Topics Covered
- Combinational logic and Boolean expressions  
- Structural design using components  
- 7-segment display interfacing  
- Multiplexers, decoders, and encoders  
- Sequential logic and shift registers  
- MOD-N counters and display output  
- ADC interfacing and PLL usage  


## Note on Commented Code
Some lab files contain multiple exercises in the same file. Commented sections represent earlier experiments or alternative implementations that were tested independently. Active code sections are ready to compile and run on the DE10-Lite.
